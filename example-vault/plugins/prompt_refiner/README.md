# Prompt Refiner Plugin

An example [Tailor](https://github.com/AGS-Lab/tailor) plugin that uses AI to refine and improve your prompts before sending them to the LLM.

## What It Does

✨ **One-Click Prompt Enhancement** — Adds a wand button to the chat composer that takes your rough prompt and transforms it into a clearer, more structured, and more effective query.

**Before:**
> explain python decorators

**After:**
> Explain Python decorators with the following: 1) What they are and their purpose, 2) How the @ syntax works, 3) A simple example with code, 4) Common use cases like @property and @staticmethod.

## How It Works

1. Type your rough prompt in the chat input
2. Click the ✨ wand button in the composer toolbar
3. The plugin uses the LLM to refine your prompt
4. Review the improved prompt and send when ready

## Requirements

- Tailor with an OpenAI API key configured
- The LLM plugin enabled in your vault

## Main Repository

This plugin is part of the **Tailor** project.
